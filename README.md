**Title:** Osmotic Learning: A Self-Supervised Paradigm for Decentralized Contextual Data Representation  
**Authors:** Anonymous (in review)  
**Abstract:** _Data within a specific context gains deeper significance beyond its isolated interpretation. In distributed systems, interdependent data sources reveal hidden relationships and latent structures, representing valuable information for many applications. This paper introduces Osmotic Learning (OSM-L), a self-supervised distributed learning paradigm designed to uncover higher-level latent knowledge from distributed data. The core of OSM-L is osmosis, a process that synthesizes dense and compact representation by extracting contextual information, eliminating the need for raw data exchange between distributed entities. OSM-L iteratively aligns local data representations, enabling information diffusion and convergence into a dynamic equilibrium that captures contextual patterns. During training, it also identifies correlated data groups, functioning as a decentralized clustering mechanism.decentralized clustering algorithm. Experimental results confirm OSM-L's  convergence and representation capabilities on structured datasets, achieving over 0.99 accuracy in local information alignment while preserving contextual integrity_.

## What is Osmotic Learning?
Osmotic Learning is a novel paradigm that enables decentralized systems to achieve a shared, higher-level understanding of distributed data. It is based on three core principles:
1. **Local Learning:** Each node independently processes its data to extract meaningful representations.
2. **Knowledge Diffusion:** The local representations are aligned iteratively to form a coherent global embedding.
3. **Emerging Structure:** Clustering mechanisms dynamically group correlated nodes, identifying latent patterns in data.

Unlike traditional federated learning, Osmotic Learning does not require direct parameter exchange but instead focuses on aligning representations, making it particularly suited for privacy-sensitive and heterogeneous distributed systems.

## Installation
### Requirements
The repository requires Python and the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. The verified Python version is 3.10.7, the system has no special requirements, but compatibility with other versions must be checked.

To install the required dependencies, run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Additionally, ensure that you have Jupyter Notebook installed if you wish to run interactive experiments:
```sh
pip install jupyter
```

## Running the Experiments

### Using Jupyter Notebook
The provided `notebook.ipynb` contains interactive code for running experiments with the Osmotic Learning paradigm. To start the notebook environment:
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
Then, open `notebook.ipynb` and follow the structured steps to run simulations and visualize the results.

### Running with `main.py`
Alternatively, you can execute the experiment pipeline directly using:
```sh
python main.py
```
This will load datasets, train models, and generate results as described in the publication.
